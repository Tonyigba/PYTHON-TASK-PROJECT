# Below is a Python project that aims at performing thorough data cleaning and then visualizing using Seaborn or Matplotlib on an imported dataset named "project". 
# In the Data Cleaning attention is on column names, data types, and an extraction of the year and year-month from the date column for easier visualization.
add the number of days from when the movie was released till today (i.e the day you're doing the visualization)

2: The countries that make the most and least movies (top 5 and bottom 5)
3: Movie trends over the years
4: Most popular country-genre mix
5: Countries with the highest average movie duration
