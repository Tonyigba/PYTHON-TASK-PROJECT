# PYTHON-TASK-PROJECT

Below is a Python project that aims at performing thorough data cleaning and then visualizing using Seaborn or Matplotlib on an imported dataset named "project". 
In the Data Cleaning attention is on column names, data types, and an extraction of the year and year-month from the date column for easier visualization.
add the number of days from when the movie was released till today (i.e the day you're doing the visualization)
